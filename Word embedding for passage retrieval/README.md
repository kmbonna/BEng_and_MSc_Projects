# Data Mining Project

## First Part

In this part, the final goal is to build a passage re-ranking system: Given a candidate list of passages to a query (that have already been retrieved using some
initial retrieval model that is developed), re-rank these candidate passages using the retrieval models.

## Second Part

in this part, the goal is to develop an information retrieval model that solves the problem of
passage retrieval, i.e., a model that can effectively and efficiently return a ranked list of short
texts (i.e. passages) relevant to a given query, improving the basic models implemented in the first part.
