# London Bus Recognition for The Visually Impaired
_Individual BEng Project_

## Overview

as of 2019 In the UK, there were approximately two million people who have a visual impairment. And around 18% of which are officially registered as
visually impaired or blind. These people struggle identifying day to day points of interests. One common problem they face is getting
around, especially using transport. This project aimed to assist the visually impaired by designing an initial computer vision-based system that
identifies London buses and their route numbers and give the user audio feedback in which they can experience.
