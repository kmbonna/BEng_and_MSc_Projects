## Overview

Energy provision has become a crucial service to all households in the 21st century. However, Energy monitoring remains minimal, with little to no extra information given to the house owner other than the cost and the total usage. Whether it be for cost saving, anomaly detection, reducing one’s carbon footprint, or just general insight, having a system that provides the user with real-time home energy monitoring would assist to achieve these mentioned goals. One of the first steps pursuing energy monitoring is Load Identification, the ability to automatically identify appliances. Now, with the new SOC (System-On-Chips) technology, sensors can be deployed inside power sockets where the individual appliance’s power draw is recorded. Leveraging this, Load Identification is then investigated in this project through the implementation of a proof-of-concept model. Some proposed ML models are then implemented following a thorough data cleaning process and then evaluated. The paper demonstrates results that are promising, showcasing an F1-Score of 80% with the best performing model on a highly imbalanced training and testing set, which will be touched upon later. The results offer an adequate stepping stone which can be built upon to further enhance and tackle the problem with further suggested extensions.
